It's a Transport Management System with Employee, finance and vehicle sub-systems. 
The project is a console based application.
I wrote it using The C++ Programming Language. 
It doesn't utilize any database at the 
moment. Nor does it include external dependencies. 
Just the  core language with the C++ Standard Library.
